# Custom-Query-Language-inspired-by-SQL-in-scala
This project implements a custom Query Language inspired by SQL, built on top of a self-developed database.
It includes operations for individual tables as well as interactions between multiple tables, allowing for flexible query combinations. The project also leverages Scala's extension methods and implicits to simplify function calls, resulting in a query syntax that is both intuitive and elegant. The goal is to create a powerful and user-friendly querying system that replicates the functionality of SQL within the custom database.
